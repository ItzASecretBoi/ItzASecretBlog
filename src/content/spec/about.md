# About

I **really** just needed a place to get my thoughts all in one place. So I've made this blog to chat about my life, make guides of how I do things, or even as just a place to take notes. With that being said you can expect me to talk a lot about my feelings, daily life, and I might even drop the occasional note or guide here. üëçüèΩ

Keep in mind my thoughts aren't always as **positive** as I am online, so they may be a little **dreary** here & there.
