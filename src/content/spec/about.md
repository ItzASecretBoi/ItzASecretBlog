## Who are you?

If you somehow got here without knowing what I do, here's the summary!

I make music which I post on [Newgrounds](https://itzasecretboi.newgrounds.com/) & [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@SecretSongz) rarely, I stream as a vtuber semi-frequently on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/itzasecretboi) & [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ItzASecretBoi), and once in a blue moon if your lucky, I may post a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ItzASecretBoi) video. ]

## Why did you wanna make a blog?

I **really** just needed a place to get my thoughts all in one place. So I've made this blog to chat about my life, make guides of how I do things, or even as just a place to take notes. With that being said you can expect me to talk a lot about my feelings, daily life, and I might even drop the occasional note or guide here. üëçüèΩ



Keep in mind my thoughts aren't always as **positive** as I typically am online, so they may be a little **dreary** here & there.
