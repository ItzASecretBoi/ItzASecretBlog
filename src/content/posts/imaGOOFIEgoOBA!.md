## Future Plans
Hello! It is currently **4:55AM on a Saturday** as I'm writing this! Not gonna lie this whole **"blogging"** thing is a nice way to get my mind straight â€” so that's exactly what I'm gonna use it for!

One of the most **important** things you can do in life is **set goals** for yourself. Otherwise you end up **frozen in time** like me lol. 

So with that being said, I decided to make a little blog post about some **future plans** of mine. Oh, and by the way, I've been working on my **OBS** a bunch, I should hopefully be **back streaming soon**. I've just been so **befuddled mentally** lately...

### 1. Income

When I think of the things most important to me, surprisingly income is one of the **last things** that come to mind. But at the same time? **Money makes the world go round**.

If I'm going to ultimately do whatever it is I'd like to do in the future, I'll need a **source of income** to invest in what makes me happy in life â€” whether it be **streaming** or anything else. So I should probably **seriously look into it**... 

I've already made a **list of local locations** to call/visit and see if they are hiring. I even already visited one of them â€” they had signs outside practically **BEGGING for employees**, but when I asked in person they told me to **apply online.... ðŸ˜‘**

And I have yet to hear back from them since I applied either...

**Whatever, their loss I guess.** If there's anything I've learned about employment, it's that you have to be **relentless** and **assertive** about it. Unless you get employed through **nepotism** or **pure luck**, it seems **pretty hard to get hired ANYWHERE** around here.

I'll call a few more locations today, **wish me luck**, I had my eyes on a **pretty dope cafe** nearby I might check out!

### 2. Invest

Ah, the hardest part â€” **managing your money**... 

While I probably should say something responsible about investing my money into respectable sources or saving it for something... **Quite frankly I know that is not gonna happen.**

I'll likely be pouring **1/2 of my income into the streams** for awhile depending on what I need, and the other **1/2 into my family**. I wanna **give a bunch back to the people who made me who I am**, starting ASAP.

### 3. Education

Honestly, **Ion even wanna talk about that**, but it **IS in the plan**. I gotta call **FASA** in these upcoming weeks.

I plan on going to a **community college** for a **bachelor's in computer science** & then seeing where the wind takes me from there!

### Conclusion

Alright that's about it! I'll be posting some notes here & there on this site as always â€” for now I'll continue **working on my OBS** so I can **get back out there**!

**Thanks for reading <3**
